# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Milestone 2

  The file milestone_2.py creates the variables needed for the construction of Hangman. This file also includes a check to see if the user input is alphabetical and a single letter

## Milestone 3

The file milestone_3.py builds on the previous one by defining two functions:

- check_guess() which firstly converts the user input called 'guess' to lowercase and then checks if guess is included in the word.   
- ask_for_input() asks the user to input a letter. This function also checks if the user input is alphabetical and a single letter. If all tests are passed then the check_guess function is called.
